      <p>Hi, I'm Sam! <br>
        I was born in Manchester, and have lived in London for the past half a decade.</p>
      <p>My degree was in Mathematics and I studied a postgraduate degree in Statistics. <br>
        Since then I've worked first as a database programmer, then as a data analyst, now as a full stack developer.</p>

      <p>I'm particularly interested in Mathematics, Physics and Philosophy. </p>
      <p>Outside of work I enjoy long walks, playing football and reading books on pretty much anything.</p>
