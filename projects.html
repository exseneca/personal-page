      <h1>Personal Projects I'm proud of</h1>
      <h2>Lisp interpreter</h2>
      <a href="https://github.com/exseneca/jisp">github.com/exseneca/jisp</a>
      <p>After working through <a href="https://craftinginterpreters.com/">crafting interpreters by Robert Nystrom</a> I went and wrote this.
        <h2>3D graph viewer</h2>
        <a href="https://github.com/exseneca/high-dimensional-draw">github.com/exseneca/high-dimensional-draw</a>
      <p>After reading about some graph drawing algorithms I thought it would be cool to implement a fast one. I read <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-36151-0_20"> Graph Drawing by High-Dimensional Embedding</a> implemented it in Clojure and build a desktop UI for viewing the graph in 3D.</p>

      <h2>River</h2>
      <a href="https://github.com/exseneca/river/">github.com/exseneca/river</a>
      <p>I wanted to build a game involving water flowing. This was the the foundation. Uses cubic splines acting as the flow forces and numerical analysis for collision detection with the banks.</p>
